            <h3>About me</h3>
            <p>I am always passionate about clothing and design. Any entrepreneur needs a healthy reserve of
                self-belief. After all, if you don't have faith in your own brand, how can
                you expect others to buy into it? However, too much confidence can be as detrimental as none.

                Confidence can be difficult to sustain, and while it's natural to have moments of self-doubt, you'll
                need to fall back
                on an in-built sense of confidence when times get tough</p>

            <p>Following on from self-confidence, to create your own fashion business you'll need to be comfortable
                taking risks.
                That's not to say you should make rash decisions, but that you will need to be able to assess business
                situations as
                they arise, and identify and mitigate risks worth taking.

                Waiting for the "right" or "perfect" set of circumstances can mean waiting forever, and "perfection
                paralysis" can stop
                many budding entrepreneurs in their tracks.

                By understanding how to use data and business intelligence to inform your decisions, you'll gain the
                confidence you need
                to identify which hunches to follow.

                It's the nature of setting up your own enterprise that not everything you do will be sure to succeed,
                but without
                pushing yourself out of your comfort zone, you'll be unlikely to reveal new opportunities.</p>
